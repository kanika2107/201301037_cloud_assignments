I have created a circular topology where we have Y swicthes each having two hosts.
All the switches are connected in a circular fashion.
Odd numbered hosts have bandwidth of 1MBPS
Even numbered hosts have bandwidth of 2MBPS
Odd hosts can only ping each other
Even hosts are only able to ping each other
